I used list STL container as underlying adaptee class. Thus, clear() function
depends upon the clear() function of the list.
STL list container has complexity n (size of list) as worst case complexity.
Thus, the worst case complexity of my clear() function is also O(n), where n is
the number of element in the stack.
